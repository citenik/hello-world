# hello-world

Aloha peps.

Marchello in the mid 30s, passionate about repetitive beats, crypto and motorcycles. Very much into computing and eager to learn code. 

My goal is to relocate to Cali and start up a family somewhere in OC and spend the rest of my days enjoying Cali sun and surf as much as I can.
